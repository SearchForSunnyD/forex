class Forex:
    """
    A utility class for currency conversion with exchange rates relative to the United States Dollar (USD).

    This class provides methods for retrieving, processing, and managing currency exchange rates. It uses USD as the reference currency for conversions
    and can also store exchange rates locally to minimize the frequency of API calls.

    Attributes:
        api_key (str): The API key used to access the currency exchange rate data from an external source.
        conv_table (dict): A dictionary containing the latest currency exchange rates or the last successfully retrieved rates from a backup file.
        supported (list): A list of supported currency codes based on the available exchange rates.

    Methods:
        - parse_conv_table: Retrieve and process currency exchange rates, using 'USD' as a reference and local storage.
        - currently_supported: Return a list of supported currency codes.
        - api_dump: Retrieve up-to-date currency exchange rates from an external API.
        - con_to_usd: Convert a value from a specified currency to USD.
        - con_from_usd: Convert a value from USD to a specified currency.
        - converter: Convert a value between currencies using USD as the reference currency, with rounding to two decimal places.
